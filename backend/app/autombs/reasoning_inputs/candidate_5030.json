There is no indication of instability, multi-system involvement, or advanced investigations. However, there is a documented loss of consciousness and physical trauma, which suggests a more than ordinary assessment beyond basic care. No duration ≥1 hour, no advanced investigations, no specialist involvement. Thus, complexity is 'more than ordinary but is not high'."
